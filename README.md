# TakeOnRules Hugo Theme

This [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) began as a fork of the [Hugo Tufte](https://github.com/shawnohare/hugo-tufte) theme.

Since that time, I've made extensive changes, and consider this to be it's own theme.

You can see this template at [Take on Rules](https://takeonrules.com).  _Note: To someone adopting this theme whole-cloth, there's a few pieces in my private repo that I also leverage.  If you are interested, [contact me](https://takeonrules.com/contact-me) and I can help._

For colors, I've adopted the palette from [Protesilaos Stavrou](https://protesilaos.com/)'s [Modus themes](https://protesilaos.com/modus-themes/); The colors are WCAG compliant and bring me a bit of joy.

## ExampleSite

No care has been taken to update the exampleSite; I have, however, uploaded a re-dacted copy of my config.yml; Hopefully that helps with working through the site.

## Semantic Markup and Linked Data

I strive for semantic markup; My goal is that I create an accessible site.  Also, as a benefit, if you disable the stylesheet the page will continue to render in a meaningful way.  _In fact, I encourage you to disable the stylesheet on most sites and see how they look._

I also include inline Linked Data, using the RDFa format.  I'm looking to provide machine-readable context which others can query; This also means that when I say "I'm writing about Stars without Number", I link to a disambiguator (e.g. Wikidata) to confirm "This is the Stars without Number" I'm writing about.

I had previously tried JSON+LD which may be more machine readable, but I found that this meant the Linked Data was separate from the associated HTML nodes that it represented.  I didn't like that.

## Partials

There are several partials that help build; Some rely on data files in my private repository.  Others help manage paragraph structures for content passed as markdown.

### Paragraph Management

The three primary paragraph management partials are:

- [unparagraphy.html](layouts/partials/unparagraphy.html) :: ensures that the partial does not return wrap the content in a P-tag.  In otherwords, useful for ensuring inline content (see display [CSS Flow Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flow_Layout)).
- [paragraphy.html](layouts/partials/paragraphy.html) :: sibling to `unparagraphy.html`, this partial ensures that the returned content'a top-level DOM nodes are P-tags.  Useful for ensuring block content.
- [smallParagraphy.html](layouts/partials/smallParagraphy.html) :: sibling to `paragraphy.html`, this partial ensures that the top-level DOM nodes are block display elements, and the children of those elements are wrapped in [small](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/small) tags.  This is useful for marginalia (e.g. side comments).

### Dates and Tags

- [dates-and-tags.html](layouts/partials/dates-and-tags.html) :: Each post has a published date and a last modified date.  I also tag each post I write with a variety of tags.  This partial helps create a uniform date and tag inline HTML.  This partial also helps add RDFa metadata to the tags.

## Shortcodes

Similar to partials, I leverage several shortcodes to help manage my content.

### Marginalia

- [sidenote.html](layouts/shortcodes/sidenote.html) :: this shortcode creates an inline numbered sidenote in the margins; It uses the `unparagraphy.html`.
- [marginnote.html](layouts/shortcodes/marginnote.html) :: this shortcode creates a block margin note.  It uses the `smallParagraphy.html`.
- [marginfigure.html](layouts/shortcodes/marginfigure.html) :: a shortcode to ensure well formed images in the marginalia.

Semantically, I don't treat these as an [ASIDE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside); Though I do add the dom attribute `role="note"`.  I have found that reader plugins don't render an aside, and I consider the marginalia important to the document.

Two other shortcodes (table.html and update.html) provide marginalia options.  See below for more on these two shortcodes.

### Cite Page

- [citePage.html](layouts/shortcodes/citePage.html) :: A shortcode to conditionally generate a `cite a` or `a` tag to the page at the given filename (relative to the Hugo content directory).  **Note:** I use [`tor-page-relative-pathname-list`](https://github.com/jeremyf/dotzshrc/blob/dd289492248b0b2719297220e4dc1127ee7c89df/emacs/jnf-blogging.el#L100-L106) to generate a list of all the filenames.

### Glossary

Throughout TakeOnRules.com, I make extensive use of a glossary.  I use this markup to improve the accessibility of my site.

- [glossary.html](layouts/shortcodes/glossary.html) :: Creates consistent markup for referencing a glossary entry.

The `glossary.html` shortcode uses the [data/glossary.yml](data/glossary.yml) file as a database.  I wrote about the Glossary in <cite><a href="http://takeonrules.com/2020/12/20/many-small-tools-make-light-work-in-emacs/" class="u-url p-name" rel="cite">Many Small Tools Make Light Work (in Emacs)</a></cite>.

#### Data Dictionary

Each glossary entry must have two keys:

- **key**: This is how you look them up; this is human understandable
- **title**: This is how you will most often refer to the thing; this is human readable and how you'd write it out in a sentence

There additional optional keys are as follows:

- **verbose_title**: This is the lengthier title; you know, if there's a colon/subtitle in play use that.
- **plural_title**: The pluralized title.
- **mention_as**: If for some reason we don't always want to use the title, the mention_as is a replacement.
- **tag**: If this entry represents a tag, this will be the tags name.
- **itemid**: If this entry has a "sameAs" itemprop value, that will be the itemid (e.g. how to disambiguate)
- **abbr**: When we provide an abbreviation, use this for the innerHTML of the `abbr` tag.
- **plural_abbr**: The pluralized abbreviation.
- **offer**: The URL where the thing is on offer (e.g. where you can buy it or borrow it).
- **game**: Indicates that this thing is a game, useful for the [`linkToGame` yasnippet](https://github.com/jeremyf/dotzshrc/blob/5c84e8b05d06b8224811b6f679ea479a67f4a6f1/emacs/snippets/text-mode/linkToGame).
- **content_disclaimers**: (Array) Indicates that this entry has some associated content disclaimer.
- **itemtype**: The schema.org itemtype for this entry.
- **description**: Similar to note, treat as `itemprop="description"`.
- **described**: A boolean.  When `true` the given glossary entry has already been described; don't attempt to fetch the description from Wikidata.

### Other Stuff

- [table.html](layouts/shortcodes/table.html) :: Helps ensure a well-formed table; one parameter allows for table rendering in the margins.
- [ogc.html](layouts/shortcodes/ogc.html) :: I sometimes write Open Game Content (OGC), released under the Open Game License (OGL).  This shortcode helps wrap that content.
- [blockquote.html](layouts/shortcodes/blockquote.html) :: I quote sources, and this shortcode helps create well-formed quotes; I also repurpose it for epigraphs.g One of my favorite books is <cite>Dune</cite> by Frank Herbert.  <cite>Dune</cite> introduces each chapter with an epigraph.  I like that style, and on occassion use that.
- [update.html](layouts/shortcodes/update.html) :: a shortcode that helps create consistent document updates, via the [INS-tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ins).  One parameter allows for updates rendered in the margins.
- [maincolumn.html](layouts/shortcodes/maincolumn.html) :: a shortcode to help render an image in the maincolumn.
